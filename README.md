Welcome

Back in the mid-80's I worked in a SunOS shop where I wrote this little ditty.  I'm not sure where I got the idea, but it surely predates GNU tree(1) by quite some time.

The myriad command line switches are there to allow inclusion of SCCS [yes, SCCS] metadata and various other extra goodness.  This was so I could include a checksum of each file as a packaging manifest that we used to ship software to customers.  There was no RPM in those days, only tar(1).

Anyway, I just got used to typing these commands, so I've kept it working over the decades.
